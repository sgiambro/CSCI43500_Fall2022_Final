Download IUPUI driving image set of 1036 high resolution images. Downsize all the images to 1/4 in width and height. 
Select a central area (approximately 1/3 of the image width and height at center) and compute gradient with 3 by 3 and 5 by 5 differential filters.
Accumulate the gradient values into two histograms separately and display them. Observe the distribution in histograms for different gradient values (from 0 to 255). 
For all the images in each category of adverse weather (foggy, snowing, raining) and clear weather (sunny, cloudy, night), accumulate image histograms to obtain a summarized histogram of each weather of these two classes.
